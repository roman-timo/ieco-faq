---
Q: Will Sadhguru be conducting the session?

A: Every aspect of the Inner Engineering Completion program is designed by Sadhguru.

Sessions 1 and 2 will be facilitated live by an Isha Yoga Instructor.

Session 3 is Sadhguru’s session. To avoid any interruption during the Shambhavi Mahamudra Kriya transmission process, the session is pre-recorded. However the process is not limited to mere instructions, but is empowered by Sadhguru’s grace and energies beyond physical boundaries and logical understanding.

Shambhavi will function as a living process within you rather than just a physical practice. If you keep yourself open and focused, time and space are no limitation for Sadhguru to transmit the Shambhavi Kriya in its full potency, no matter how far you are.

How to receive this properly will be approached in more detail during the program.
